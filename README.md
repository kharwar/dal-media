# Dal Media
Dal Media is a social networking application for Dalhousie students and professors. The main goal of the platform is to provide an informal way of connecting with the peers and seniors. 

The application uses ReactJS as the frontend framework with conjunction to MUI as the styling library. MVC Architecture has been followed at the backend which is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS interacting with MongoDB as the database. 

You can find the deployed application [here](https://grp11-dalmedia-production.herokuapp.com/).
